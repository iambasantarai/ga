<h1 align="center">ga/'ग'</h1>

A toy programming language in the [Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari) script that follows the grammatical and syntactical constructs of [Nepali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) language.

### Getting started

Currently, only the lexer has been implemented for this language. If you're curious about the progress and want to see it in action, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:x-incubator/ga.git && cd ga
  ```

- Run the example program

  ```bash
  cargo run ./examples/init.ga
  ```
